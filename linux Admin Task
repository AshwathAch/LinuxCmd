Task 1
Setting permissions
  1. SUID --> SUID allows the file to be run with the privileges of the file owner (often the root) rather than the user who runs it.
              chmod u+s/4755 Filename
  2. SGID --> SGID allows the file to run with the permissions of the group owner. When applied to directories, SGID ensures new files inherit the group ownership of the directory rather than the user’s primary group.
              chmod g+s/2755 Filename
  3. Sticky bit --> this bit prevents users from deleting files owned by others within the directory. Only the file owner, directory owner, or root can delete them. It’s indicated by a "t" in the "others" executable position, e.g., drwxrwxrwt.
              chmod +t directory_name
  4. ACL --> ACLs provide more granular control than standard permissions, allowing you to define specific permissions for individual users or groups beyond the file’s owner, group, and others. ACLs are especially useful in environments where complex permissions are needed. You can use commands like setfacl to define ACLs and getfacl to view them.
              setfacl -m u:username:permissions filename_or_directory
              setfacl -m g:groupname:permissions filename_or_directory

Task 2
Process Managment
  1.top –-> Real-time Process Monitoring
      Key shortcuts:
      q: Quit top.
      k: Kill a process by entering its PID.
  2. ps –-> Process Snapshot
      ps aux: Displays all processes with detailed information.
      ps -ef: Shows all processes in a full-format listing.
  3. vmstat –-> vmstat provides an overview of system performance, including memory, swap, CPU, and I/O statistics.
      Fields to note:
      r: Processes waiting for run time.
      free: Free memory.
      si and so: Swap in and swap out rates.
      us, sy, id: User, system, and idle CPU percentages.

Task 3
Disk Partition
  Primary Partitions: These are the main partitions, and you can create up to four on a disk (MBR-based).
  Extended Partitions: A workaround for the primary partition limit. You can create one extended partition that can hold multiple logical partitions.
  Logical Partitions: Created within an extended partition, these are treated as independent drives by the system.
  Swap Partition: Dedicated space used as virtual memory, where data from RAM can temporarily swap to disk. This is essential for systems with low RAM, especially in Linux.
  View all partitions--> sudo fdisk -l, lsblk, sudo parted -l, df -h

Task 4
NFS and SAMBA
  NFS --> share directories on the same network.(Linux to Linux)
  Configure /etc/exports --> /path/to/shared_folder 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
  Restart NFS.
  SAMBA --> Used to share files between Linux and Windows systems.(Cross platform)
  Configure /etc/samba/smb.conf  --> Share name / Path = , Browsable = , writable = , guest ok = , read only = .
  Restart samba
  Mount on Linux --> sudo mount -t cifs //server_IP/ShareName /path/to/mount_point -o username=your_username

Task 5 
SELinux --> provides a set of security policies that control how processes and users interact with files, devices, and other resources.
  Each file, process, and resource in SELinux has a security context, which looks like this:
  user:role:type:level
  Modes of linux  : Enforcing(unauthorised access are blocked)
                    Permissive(SElinux logs the blocked action)
                    Disabled(No policies enforced)

Task 6
SSH(Secure Shell) --> protocol for secure remote access to servers and other networked devices.
SSH encrypts data sent between, uses public key cryptography, uses port 22.
  Install SSH, start and connect by entering username and IP address.
  scp copy files from server, sftp secure file transfer.
  SSH Configuration --> /etc/ssh/sshd_config(Disable RootLogin for more security, Change default port)

Task 7 
Networking and firewall basics

Task 8 
Cron scheduling --> Job scheduler to automate tasks.
  Cron jobs -> Tasks scheduled, Crontab -> Configuration file where tasks are defined.
  Crontab --> * * * * * command(Min,Hour,Date,Month,Day of week)
  crontab -e(Open file), -l(List), -r(Remove jobs)

Task 9
Configuration files
  SSH --> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  Apache --> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  MySQl/MariaDB --> /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf
  Crontabs--> /etc/crontab
  NFS --> /etc/exports
  SMB --> /etc/samba/smb.conf 
  chrony --> /etc/chrony.conf
  network configuration(Debian/Ubuntu) --> /etc/network/interfaces
  network configuration(RHEL/CentOS) --> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
  Postfix(Mail Transfer) --> /etc/postfix/main.cf
  Firewall --? /etc/firewalld/zones/*.xml
  GRUB --> /etc/default/grub

Task 10
Shell Scripting --> Automate task 
  Save shell files with .sh extension, make executable(chmod +x), Run script
  Use variables, get input(read), echo(output).
